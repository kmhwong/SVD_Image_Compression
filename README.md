# SVD_image_compression

This example illustrates the application of Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) for image compression, extracted and modified from Chapter 1 of Brunton & Kutz (2019). The original code, which is presented in Part 2 below, demonstrates image compression in greyscale. In contrast, Part 1 showcases the parallel compression process in RGB scale (i.e., for colorful images).
